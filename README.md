# ASLAssist
ASLAssist aims to aid the deaf-mute towards a completely wireless platform by converting American Sign Language to a text form. It can be used as a web chat for the deaf-mute.

# Getting Started
Please create a folder called 'pictures' in the place where you have downloaded all the code.We first run app.py to open the webcam and click the pictures of your ASL signs.INSTRUCTION: Click c to keep taking more pictures and q twice to stop the webcam and to close all windows. Next we call main.py which is our flask file to open the server and display the front end. For main.py to open the local server a folder has to be created and inside the folder, another folder called template must be created and main.py must be stored in it.Now run main.py. This opens your server and leads you to the front end.
